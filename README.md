## CS 231

This repository includes the latex and SML coursework assignments assigned for CS 231 at UCLA for Fall 2013.

## Vagrant

If you don't want to install SML on your machine you can download and install VirtualBox and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) to automate the setup of a VM with SML. After installing both from the root directory run

```
vagrant up
vagrant provision
vagrant ssh
```

The first command will build the VM and share the project directory with it, the second step will install SML (*TODO*), and the third will allow you to enter the VM and run commands.

## LaTeX

*TODO* List of packages.
